Description of examples:

Example00_SetUpEnvironment:
-activates and instantiates julia environment.

Example01_EllipticPde:
-assembles linear system of fem discretization for the heat equation
with a heterogeneous isotropic coefficient field using 2D P1 elements.

Example02_KarhunenLoeve:
-assembles (and solves) the generalized eigenvalue problem obtained by 
fem for the Karhunen-Loeve expansion of a Gaussian process.

Example03_EllipticPdeDomainDecomposition:
-prepares and assembles, or not, operators obtained by fem discretization for 
the heat equation with a heterogeneous isotropic coefficient field using 
non-overlaping domain decomposition.
-prepares and asembles, or not, corresponding preconditioners for both,
the original system A * u = b, as well as for the Schur complement system.
-shows effect of deflation on NeumannNeumannSchurPreconditioner for the 
Schur complement system of a toy problem.
-shows effect of deflation on LorascPreconditioner for A * u = b.
-shows lack of effect of deflation on AMGPreconditioner for A * u = b. 

Example04_KarhunenLoeveDomainDecomposition:

problems obtained by fem for the "local" and "global" Karhunen-Loeve 
expansions of a Gaussian process.

Example05_KarhunenLoevePllDomainDecomposition:
-parallel implementation of the use of domain decomposition to assemble 
(and solve) generalized eigenvalue problems obtained by fem for the "local"
and "global" Karhunen-Loeve expansions of a Gaussian process.

Example06_PcgStochasticEllipticPde:
-assembles (and quickly re-assembles) linear systems of fem discretization 
for the heat equation with a heterogeneous isotropic lognormal coefficient field. 
-shows how to assemble constant preconditionners for given realizations. 
-shows effect of deflation on "median" LorascPreconditioner for A * u = b.

 realizations.
